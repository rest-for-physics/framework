This directory will serve to link external repositories as a submodule to include and promote different REST-for-Physics projects. Some projects may be private and they will require that users request access to them.

The REST-for-Physics projects contain detector data analysis, detector event reconstruction, detector Monte Carlo response, background simulations, detector setup geometries and detector readout definitions. Between other components.

List of projects included:
 - **Basic-Examples**: It gathers basic examples to serve as a first contact for new REST-for-Physics users.
 - **IAXO**: The software project for the IAXO Collaboration.
 - **TREX-DM**: The software project for the TREX-DM experiment.
 - **AlphaCAMM**: The software project for the Alpha-CAMM project.
