\brief A list of the different event data processes implemented in REST together with a brief funcionality description.

## Data transformation processes

These processes are in charged of transforming data between different basic data types in REST.

As soon as we transform one data type to another we can make use of the dedicated data type processes. For example, if we have a geant4 event (TRestGeant4Event), we may transform it to a basic hits event (TRestHitsEvent) and continue processing the event using the basic *hit processes*.

REST process | Input type | Output type | Description
-------------|------------|-------------|------------
TRestRawSignalToSignalProcess               | TRestRawSignal    | TRestSignalEvent  | Transforms a rawsignal into a signal event.

TRestDetectorHitsToTrackFastProcess                 | TRestHitsEvent    | TRestTrackEvent   | Hit clusterization into tracks by proximity (Aproximation).
TRestGeant4ToHitsProcess                        | TRestGeant4Event      | TRestHitsEvent    | Transforms a geant4 event into a hits event.

## Analysis processes

These are pure analysis processes. They do not transform the event data itself but add new observables/branches to TRestAnalysisTree. They may apply cuts to the event data, somehow deciding if an event should continue being processed. Any process can decide to stop processing an event by just returning a NULL pointer. This should be documented in each process class.

## Signal processes

These processes just modify the data inside a signal event, returning again a signal event data type. These kind of processes add signal noise to simulated data, filter noise from rawdata, shape the input signal, or suppress signal data points which are under threshold.

## Hit processes

These processes just modify the data inside a hits event, returning again a hits event data type. These kind of processes normalize hits energy, fiducialize hits in a given volume, drift and diffuse hits, or reduce the hit number using merging algorithms.

## Track processes

These processes operate over track event data, or a set of hits that have been grouped into tracks. We may find the minimum path between the hits inside each track, reduce the number of hits inside each track, find the track ends, or project the hits over the main trajectory effectively linearizing the track.
