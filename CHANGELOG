Title : Several changes on configuration, metadata, restG4 and restcore
==========================================================

# Major change on the structure of configuration directory.

Now config/ is distributed in diferent directories. Each directory related to a specific example of use of REST. An important change is that now the geometry of our detector setup is also stored inside the config directory tree 

We will find the following new directories inside :

* config/template (old myConfig.rml/mySetupTemplate.rml): It contains always a basic template for the first use inside REST, and for testing pourposes, any new metadata field should be always added to the template configuration.

* config/IAXODO : It contains geometry and setup configuration for IAXOD0 simulations.

* config/pandaXIII : Configuration files related to pandaXIII setup. It contains several geometry setups, traditional, resistive, etc.

The pandaXIII directory contains just prototyped configuration files under pandaXIII/templates/ directory. The pandaXIII directory can be populated with specific config files using the following scripts:
    
      - generateExamples.sh : produces specific metadata files.
      - cleanExamples.sh : removes configuration files generated with generateExamples.sh

# Additional changes on configuration

* Now the path to the geometry must be specicified inside restG4 section. We can then launch restG4 from anywhere we want. The geometry will be read from wherever we specify inside the configuration file (see template/config.rml).

* If REST_CONFIG is not specified (and the configuration files are not found in the directory from where we are launching REST) REST will define a internal configuration path pointing to `$REST_PATH/config/`. Thus, we must specify the configuration files inside REST relative to this path. Thus, if we do not define any REST_CONFIG, it will be `template/config.rml` or `pandaXIII/vessel/Th232.rml`.

* Added a script `replaceRMLVars.py` inside config/ directory. This script is used to replace enviromental variables in a prototyped configuration template substituting them for specific values.

---
Example : 
  replaceRMLVars.py inputFile.rml outputFile.rml [REST_NEVENTS=100000;REST_ISOTOPE=Tl208;REST_RUN=100]
---

# Changes on restG4

* Geometry setups have been removed from `restG4` and `restG4-build`. `CMakeLists.txt` has been updated accordingly. Geometry files are not copied anymore to `restG4-build`.

* Now `restG4` main will import the GDML geometry `TGeoManager::Import(GDMLfile)` and append it to the ROOT file generated.

* The `subEventID` definition has changed. Now a new parameter `subEventTimeDelay` has been added to `TRestG4Metadata`. If this parameter is not defined it will take by default 1 second. Events with timeStamp containned inside the `subEventTimeDelay` will be considered as a single `subEventID`.

# Changes on inputData

* inputData/definitions : New directory containning common definitions : `readouts.rml`, `materials.xml`, `gases.rml`
       In order to implement materials.xml in specific configurations we just use a symbolic link.
       materials.xml symlink has been added to the different geometries in the configuration directories.

     Note : Now we must specify full path when referencing a file. 

---
Example:
  <section gas nameref="Gas name" file="{REST_PATH}/inputData/definitions/gases.rml" >
---

* inputData/distributions : Added `HighEnergyGammaBiasing.root` distribution containning the resulting gamma after biasing in a water tank (see README).


# Changes in restcore

* The geometry `TRestGeometry::TGeoManager` is not anymore contained by `TRestRun`.
    Undetermined problems were found when doing `fGeometry->Write()`, problems with `TGeoManager` serialization?

* New method `GetEventWithID(Int_t id)`: This methods gets the tree entry correspoding to the event with `fEventID==id`.
    Thus, it fills the fInputEvent structure inside `TRestRun` with the event with `id`.

* A new member `vector <Int_t> fEventIDs;` has been added to the TRestRun members. 
    This is a vector that relates directly the entries on the eventTree with its eventID. 
    It is used in `GetEventWithID(id)` for quick pick-up of the required event with a specific `id`.

And other minor fixes.

==========================================================

== RESTCORE ==

- TRestRun. 
    + SetVersion now takes the commit identificative number and writes it in the filename.
    + The version member value inside TRestRun is properly updated now each time we open an output file, so that the version from the input file is not necesarily preserved.

== RESTMETADATA ==

- TRestReadout. 
    + GetX and GetY now verify the case where we have 1-pixel strip. In order to return NaN in the undefined direction.
    + Fixed a small spelling bug in GetX() and GetY().

== RESTTOOLS ==

- TRestMesh now associates a NaN value to node 0.

== RESTEVENTS ==

- TRestSignal and TRestSignalEvent.
    + TGraph has been removed from TRestSignalEvent. 
    + TRestSignal implements now a GetGraph method and defines the fGraph. 
    + Changes in TRestSignalEvent::DrawEvent using the new GetGraph method.
    + Removed vector2 member that was just used to return a value in a method!!

- TRestHits and TRestHitsEvent. Added new methods:
    + GetDistanceToNode( n ) : Obtains the distance from the first node to node n.
    + GetVector( n, m ) : Gets the vector defined by n and m hits.
    + GetClosestHit( position ) : Gets the closest hit to position.
    + GetProjection( n, m, position ) : Returns the longitudinal and transversal projections of position in the vector created by n and m nodes.
    + GetMeanDistance() : Returns the mean energy-weighted position of the hits.
    + Revisited areXY methods and GetXArray methods to properly handle NaN values.
    + GetXZHits methods now preserve the NaN values of the hits.
    + GetDistance method verifies now if the hits are projected in a particular plane.
    

- TRestTrackEvent. Added new methods:
    + GetOriginTrackID() : Finds the original track from which this track derives (the one with parentID = 0).

- New event types. TRestLinearTrack and TRestLinearizedTrackEvent.
    + A linear track stores longitudinal and transversal projections of the track inside a TRestSignal structure.
    + It includes additional members : trackEnergy, meanPosition.

== RESTPROCESSES ==

- TRestElectronDiffusionProcess.
    + fGas is properly initialized to NULL solving problem of segmentation fault when we use a TBrowser to open a file containning this process.

- TRestPathMinimizationProcess. 
    + Added error handling in case Heldkarp minimization method fails.

- TRestTRackReductionProcess.
    + The event processing has been modified. The process now starts merging hits at the new parameter startingDistance. All nodes within this distance will be merged. The process continues increasing the merging distance multiplying this distance by the new metadata parameter distanceStepFactor. The process continues as soon as the number of nodes is below the metadata parameter maxNodes or the metadata parameter minimumDistance has not been reached.

- New process. TRestTrackLinearizationProcess. 
    + This process projects the origin tracks from a TRestEventTrack using the top layer tracks (or nodes) as reference. The result is stored in the new event types TRestLinearizedTrackEvent.

== SCRIPTS ==

- New script. RESTSIM_G4ToSignal : Concatenates several simulation processes to obtain a Signal event directly from a Geant4 event.
- New script. RESTSIM_G4ToTrack : Concatanates simulation and analysis processes to obtain the final processed track event.

== INPUTDATA/CONFIG ==

- Uploaded AGET signal response files.
- Updated myConfig.rml with new metadata parameters of TRestTrackReductionProcess.
- Updated myConfig.rml with a new section for the new process TRestTrackLinearizationProcess.

New signal process : TRestAddSignalNoiseProcess. It adds white gaussian noise to a TRestSignal. It converts a TRestSignal into another TRestSignal. The noise is introduced in electrons, not as an int number but as a float. It uses a metadata: noiseLevel that would define the noise standard deviation.

==========================================================

- TRestRun. Added time measurement for event processing, writting and reading. The time measurement will print out on screen after it has finished processing all the events. It can be deactivated by commenting out the line #define TIME_MEASUREMENT. In future this might be given as an option for the compiler.

- TRestEvent. Added a new member, fOK. This member is initialized to true by the original input process (restG4 or restAGET, ...). The processes may set the status of the event to a BAD state using this member in case something went wrong processing that event.

==========================================================

A new library has been created to store all the classes that are used as tools. TRestFFT has been moved to this new module libRestTools.so.

A new tool class TRestMesh has been created to help on definning node relation of a distribution of hits. A node is related to another node if it is found within 1-cell distance from it, then the nodes will be associated to the same group number.

For the moment node association to a group is defined by using 1-cell neighbour. This could be generalized in the future to n-cell neighbourds. Then we may increase cell granularity, and even define spherical node association topology.

A new process TRestFastHitsToTrackProcess has been added. This process uses TRestMesh to find the relation between the hits in order to define the tracks. The process requires to define the net size, net position and cell resolution (or size). See updates in myConfig.rml.

Issues #2 and #3 have been solved by this merge.

Changes in TRestMetadata related to config path definition and environmental values interpretation inside a config file.

New method TRestMetadata::ReplaceEnvironmentalVariables used to parse environmental variables inside a config file.

REST now will read configuration files from a path using the following priorities:

1) It will try to find first the configuration file inside REST_CONFIG

2) If it does not find the config file (or REST_CONFIG), it will try to find the config file in the directory where we are launching our executable

3) If still, it does not find the config file it will try to find it at REST_PATH/config.


Added CHANGELOG file. It should contain similar information to the information given when we do a merge request.
