File : CosmicGammas.root
Histograms : hLEgamma, hMEgamma, hHEgamma

Description : It contains three distributions (all of them normalized) corresponding to gammas at sea level (from tables in "Cosmic Rays at Earth" by Grieder (Ed. Elsevier)). Flux data from the same book and also from a comparative integral.

  - hLEgamma : Low energy gammas distribution. From 1 to 10 MeV (bin size 100 keV).
               Flux : 8e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

  - hMEgamma : Medium energy gammas distribution. From 10 to 100 MeV (bin size 100 keV).
               Flux : 4e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

  - hHEgamma : Medium energy gammas distribution. From 0.1 to 100 GeV (bin size 100 MeV).
               Flux : 1e-3 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 (same for e- and e+)

Notes :
    - Electrons (e-) and positrons (e+) should follow similar distributions.
    - It is assumed that angular distributions should go with Cos^2.
      The angular distribution can be found in file "CosmicAngles.root" and histogram "Theta2".

File : RadioactivityGammas.root
Histograms : Th232, U238, ThetaAngle

Description : Full chain decay simulation of Th232 and U238 launched uniformly inside a concrete wall. Then the gammas coming out the wall are counted and its energy filled inside the histograms Th232 and U238. 

    - Th232 : Gamma energy spectrum resulting from Th232 decay chain (Energy units in keV).

    - U238 : Gamma energy spectrum resulting from U238 decay chain (Energy units in keV).

    - ThetaAngle : Resulting angular distribution from the gamma flux. Theta=0 is the direction normal to the surface.

Notes : 
    - The total number of counts inside the energy distributions corresponds to a simulation of 20M events in a concrete mass of 17664 tonnes.
    - The phi angular distribution is uniform.

File : HighEnergyGammaBiasing.root
Histograms : Th232_Spectrum, Th232_Angular, U238_Spectrum, U238_Angular


Description: This file contains the energy spectrum and angular distribution of the gammas biased through several biasing volumes inside a water tank.
             The gammas are initially launched from the boundaries of a water tank of 12m side, using energy distributions Th232 and U238 given by RadiactivityGammas.root
             The resulting biasing energy and angular spectra at a virtualBox of 2.5m side are registered in this file.

    - Th232_Spectrum    :  Energy spectrum between 2.4MeV and 15MeV (Units in keV)

    - U238_Spectrum     :  Energy spectrum between 2.4MeV and 15MeV (Units in keV)

    - Th232_Angular     :  Theta angular distibution (Direction normal to the virtualBox walls).

    - U238_Angular      :  Theta angular distibution (Direction normal to the virtualBox walls).

Each of these spectra is given for different virtual box sizes (2500mm, 3000mm and 4000mm). 
Thus Th232_Spectrum_2500 contains the gammas that reached the biasing volume at 2500mm.

Note : These spectra have been generated using config/pandaXIII/biasing/external[Th232,U238].rml

The biasing factors used to obtain the final biasing spectra at the 2.5m virtualBox are given in the following table
    
                        Vbox size  |  Th232  |  U238
