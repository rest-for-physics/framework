Examples of library should include:

1. a basic RML describing a data processing chain.

2. RML loading any existing metadata structures. So that we can test using new TRestXXXMetadata( "example.rml")

3. Any other examples

Naming convention still pending. Necessary?

Some of these examples may require external ROOT file with pre-generated data to work. We should probably host some dummy data in a server for this purpouse.
