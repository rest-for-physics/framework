The following scripts are used to validate the PandaX-III simulation & topological analysis chain.

- **step 1**: Use `restG4 Xe136bb0n.rml` to run test Geant4 simulation. Use `ValidateG4.C` to check if the simulation
  produced the expected output. i.e. all 500 events are simulated and metadata is correctly recorded. The output file
  will be used later on.

- **step 2**: Use `AllProcesses.rml` to run restManager for REST simulation and topological analysis. `processes_2D.rml`
  and `readout-140kg.rml` is included by it.

- **step 3**: Use `plots.rml` to check the plots can be successfully drawn by TRestAnalysisPlot

File `Xe136bb0n_small_reference.root` corresponds to the file generated by step 1 using Geant4 11.0.2 but with a smaller
number of simulated events to reduce size. events.
